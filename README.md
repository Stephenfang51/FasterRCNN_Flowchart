# FasterRCNN_Flowchart
The very first basic model of FasterRCNN flow chart designed by me

It's not just a simple flowchart but also more detailed, you can see that the most important process for FasterRCNN already included in the boxes. You can almost understand the whole process with this single chart.

I usually read the source code with the flowchart, feel free to use it.
